          <h3>The problem:</h3>
          <h4>
            In today's world, physical and mental health conditions continue to
            persist. While there are plenty of medications that help to
            alleviate symptoms, certain medication can often lead to further
            health risks. Oftetimes, this can disempower those who are battling
            with these issues.
          </h4>
          <h3>The solution:</h3>
          <h4>
            This issue led to the development of TeaCart. It's a tea delivery
            app that has a vast array of teas to alleviate mental and physical
            conditions in a holistic way.
          </h4>
          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <h4>
            I decided to do a competitive analysis on the top two holisitc
            remedy apps to see how it could strengthen TeaCart. I did my third
            analysis on CVS Pharmacy app because even though it's not a
            holisitic remedy app, it is the top leading pharmaceutical delivery
            app. CVS was important to analyze since the goal is to empower
            people to transition to holisitic remedies.

          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <h4>
            Once I figured out the weak points of my competitors, I determined
            the main course of action I wanted the user to accomplish in
            TeaCart. These tasks would include going through the onboarding
            process by sharing the physical and mental conditions the user
            experiences, selecting their teas, and toggling between different
            conditions to control what they see on their daily feed.
          </h4>

          <h3>Moodboard</h3>
          <h4>
            When the main actions were established through user flows, I thought
            about how I wanted my users to feel when using TeaCart. I determined
            I wanted them to feel hopeful and inspired, especially considering
            they are dealing with mental and phsycial health conditions that
            could potentially be pretty stressful. Soft yellows instantly came
            to mind, while choosing San Francisco and Roboto as the fonts to
            stick to android and iOS guidelines.
